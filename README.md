## Declare Javascript Variables

Javascript provides 8 different data types which are null,undefined,boolean,string,symbol,bigint,number,object.
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
```javascript
// declare a variable by putting var keyword in front of it.
var ourName;
let userName;
const myNumber;
```
In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
