## Declare Javascript Variables

Javascript provides 8 different data types which are null,undefined,boolean,string,symbol,bigint,number,object.
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
```javascript
// declare a variable by putting var keyword in front of it.
var ourName;
let userName;
const myNumber;
```
In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

## Storing values with the assignment operator

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=)
```javascript
var myVar;
myVar=10;
```
 
## Assigning the value of one variable to another variable

```javascript
var myVar;
myVar=10;
var myNum;
myNum=myVar;
```

## Initializing the variable with the assignment operator

```javascript
var myVar=0;
```
